# Policy Service — Progress & Phase Plan

## Governance Platform audit closure — 2026-10-14 (current status)

This section supersedes the status paragraphs below them. Those describe the
July build; several of their claims stopped being true when the canonical
envelope was enforced (for example "decision log verified live 2026-07-07":
from enforcement until today every evidence write was refused with 400 and
only logged). The audit is `docs/audit_files/Governance Platform-audit-2026-09-28.md`,
section 3/7, and its closing record "policy-svc — gap closure (14 October 2026)".

**Decisions (user, 14 Oct):** GOV-05 + Doc 03 §8.1 bind this service (V-001's
PDC-05 suite is roadmap); Evaluate stores evidence locally in the same
transaction and the ledger copy follows from an outbox (C6); the ledger writer
is this service's own principal, `POLICY_LEDGER_PRINCIPAL_ID` (D-02); policy
families are tenant-owned by default (Q5). Decided from the documents: Evaluate
is exempt from `MaterialWrite`, as authorization-svc's `/v1/authorize` is (C5).

**What changed (migration `000007_gov05_lifecycle` + code):**

- GOV-05 lifecycle: DRAFT → REVIEW → APPROVED → ACTIVE (or SCHEDULED when
  `effective_from` is in the future) → SUPERSEDED / SUSPENDED / RETIRED. The
  author can neither approve nor activate (403 `SOD_CONFLICT`); nothing goes
  live unapproved (409 `APPROVAL_REQUIRED`). Every transition is in
  `policy_version_transitions`; `If-Match` / `expected_version` give
  optimistic concurrency (`row_version`, returned as `ETag`).
- Bitemporal resolution (`internal/resolve`): `as_of` and `known_at`;
  effective windows gate; a successor takes over at its own effective time;
  a suspended version never hands control back to its predecessor; two
  policies tied at the most specific scope are CONFLICTED, never
  latest-by-timestamp. Activation of an overlapping same-scope policy of the
  same type is refused (409 `POLICY_CONFLICTED`).
- Evaluate: actor from `X-Principal-Id`, authorized as `POLICY_EVALUATE`;
  legal entity reconciled with `X-Legal-Entity-Id`; a repeated `decision_id`
  returns the stored result (different input: 409 `IDEMPOTENCY_MISMATCH`);
  the payload is checked against its server-derived `artifact_digest`; the
  evaluation (input fingerprint, evaluator version, selected rule ids, as-of
  and known-at) is stored with its ledger outbox row before 200, and
  `evidence_id` is returned. `internal/evidence` delivers it to
  governance-decision-log-svc with the full envelope, the caller's tenant in
  the header (no more `"GLOBAL"` body tenant) and `PLATFORM` for unscoped
  entities.
- Reads are authorized (`POLICY_READ`). Mode switches `POLICY_EVALUATE_AUTHZ`
  and `POLICY_READ_AUTHZ` (`enforce` default, `warn` in compose until the
  callers and grants below are ready).
- Released content is immutable in the database (triggers on UPDATE, DELETE,
  TRUNCATE); policies, versions, transitions, evaluations, control-test
  executions and attestations are under FORCE RLS.
- The transactional outbox is now transactional (events are written in the
  business transaction) and actually publishes (the relay used to set a topic
  kafka-go refuses); event ids are stable per row; backlogs are exported as
  `outbox_pending`, `outbox_oldest_pending_seconds`, `policy_evidence_pending`
  and `policy_evidence_failed`.
- Resolution cache (`internal/cache`) keyed by type, tenant and entity,
  valid only while `policy_resolution_watermark` is unchanged.
- Stable error classes (GCP §16) in a `code` field; the old `error` value is
  kept for existing callers. Malformed ids and over-length strings are 400.

**API surface** (REST; GOV-05's `/internal/v1/gov05/...` paths are
"illustrative contract surface"):

| Route | GOV-05 / Doc 03 operation | Permission |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/policies` (`scope` TENANT \| GLOBAL) | CreatePolicyDraft (family) | `POLICY_CREATE` / `POLICY_CREATE_GLOBAL` |

Events (Doc 03 dotted names, pending group decision C3): `policy.created`,
`policy.updated`, `policy.version.submitted`, `policy.version.approved`,
`policy.version.scheduled`, `policy.version.activated`,
`policy.version.suspended`, `policy.rule.retired` (supersession and
retirement), `policy.applicability.conflicted`.

**Deploy order:** apply `000007` (`deployments/migrate.py up`) before the new
binary. Set `POLICY_LEDGER_PRINCIPAL_ID` and grant it
`GOVERNANCE_DECISION_RECORD`. Existing DRAFT versions must now go through
submit-review and approve before activation. A create-version retry is
replayed by its `Idempotency-Key` (or `policy_version_id`), no longer by
(scope, effective_from).

**Round 2 (same day):** access-control-svc migration 000019 registers the 9
new actions; expense-claim-svc and payment-authorization-svc forward
`X-Principal-Id`, the signed envelope, request and correlation ids;
`deployments/scripts/seed-demo-rbac.ps1` grants the actions and gives
`svc-policy` `GOVERNANCE_DECISION_RECORD`; compose enforces both gates.
Added: identity verification (`internal/identity`; the signed envelope from
identity-context-svc's JWKS must agree with the identity headers, or the
caller is an mTLS peer on the new `:8449` listener, `internal/mtlslistener`);
mandatory `If-Match` / `expected_version` on lifecycle commands (428);
`POST …/review-suspension` (independent review of an emergency suspension,
migration 000008); `jurisdiction_context` and `residency_region` on events; the
version's author sent to authorization-svc as the resource owner, so its
own-object SoD rules apply too. Verified live against the real
authorization-svc (24/24 + 3/3).

**Still open:** evaluation for SPEND_CONTROL, SIGNATORY_MATRIX and SOD_RULE
(no spec defines them); compose keeps `POLICY_IDENTITY_VERIFY=warn` until
governance-decision-log-svc's replay forwards the signed envelope (P-12);
`X-Purpose-Context: policy_evaluation_evidence` is sent because the decision log
requires it on appends (its open decision D-06).

**Verification (14 Oct):** unit and handler suites; 13 database tests run as
a NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS role on Postgres 16 (migration backfill and
round-trip included); 10/10 mutants killed; race detector clean; live run of
both real binaries (policy-svc and governance-decision-log-svc) with a stub
authorization-svc: 44/44 negative-path checks, including ledger rows for
tenant-scoped and global evaluations. The live run found the missing
`X-Purpose-Context`, which no unit test could.

Status (July 2026, superseded by the section above): **All 3 original batches (A, B, C) plus follow-ups Batch D, E, and
F built.** A, B, C, D, and E were tested and verified live in a prior
session — including a real Docker image build and a real second live
service (`governance-decision-log-svc`) for cross-service proof. **Batch F
(2026-07-08, below) was written the same way but has NOT been run in this
session** — no Go toolchain or running Docker daemon was available this
time. Treat Batch F as written-but-unverified until `go build`/
`go vet`/`go test ./... -v` (with `TEST_DATABASE_URL` set) is actually run
once, locally or in CI. This overall approach supersedes the earlier
15-phase speculative plan: the build was task-approved and scoped into 3
sequential batches, each its own branch off `main` in
`ZoikoGroup/zoiko-suite-backend`; Batch D followed from a spec-compliance
self-review (see "so what we need to do to make it 100% aligned" in
conversation), and Batch F followed from a second such review (see
"can we be 100% aligned" and its answer, this same day). Full citations,
exact schema, exact endpoint contracts, and exact code patterns to mirror
are in `context.md` §13. **policy-svc's v1 scope, including its evidence
obligation, is now functionally complete pending Batch F's verification**
— see `context.md` §19/§22 for the closing summaries and what's genuinely
left for a human to decide (see the "TODO — Deferred functionality"
section below) versus what's actually done.

**Verification actually performed (2026-07-07):** no Go toolchain exists
in the assistant's sandbox, so a Docker container (`golang:1.25-alpine`)
was used to run `go mod tidy`, `go vet ./...`, `go build`, and
`go test ./... -v` against a real throwaway Postgres 16 container.
Batch A: 19/19 tests pass; one real bug found and fixed (JSONB whitespace
comparison — `context.md` §15). Batch B: added on top, 27/27 tests pass
on the first run, no new bugs. Batch C: added event publishing (which
required extending `ActivateVersion`'s return signature to report
superseded versions and a `transitioned` flag — a real refactor across
store/handler/tests, not just new files), **29/29 tests pass**; then the
actual `Dockerfile` was built into a real image and run against Postgres
— full create→version→activate→supersede→evaluate round trip exercised
from inside that image, with all four event types confirmed actually
emitted in the logs, including `policy.rule.retired` correctly tied to
the same correlation ID as the activation call that caused it. See
`context.md` §16 (Batch A transcript), §17 (Batch B transcript), §18
(Batch C transcript).

## TODO — Deferred functionality (single source of truth, 2026-07-08)

Everything below was deliberately left out of v1. Grouped by *why*, because
that determines what actually unblocks each one — not all of it is waiting
on another service, and it's a mistake to treat this list as one
undifferentiated backlog. **This section supersedes the scattered mentions
of these same items in "Explicit non-goals," "Blocking cross-service
dependencies," and "Remaining gaps" further down this file — update this
list, not those.**

### Blocked on a service that doesn't exist yet (not a decision — unblocks automatically once it lands)

1. **Consume `role.updated`** — blocked on Access Control Service not existing.
2. **Consume `authority.delegated`** — blocked on Delegated Authority Service not existing.
3. **Authorization-check the admin write endpoints** (`CreatePolicy`,
   `CreatePolicyVersion`, `ActivateVersion`) — blocked on Authorization
   Service not existing. **Live gap worth knowing about**: today, any
   caller can create or activate a policy; there is no service-side check
   on who is allowed to. Same posture every other Tier 0 service in this
   repo currently ships with, not unique to policy-svc — but worth not
   forgetting.

### Needs business input only you can supply (not another service's problem)

4. **Evaluation logic for `SPEND_CONTROL`, `SOD_RULE`, `SIGNATORY_MATRIX`**
   — `03-microservices.md` names these three policy types but gives zero
   formulas, unlike `APPROVAL_THRESHOLD`'s explicit "compare against a
   threshold." Needs the actual business rule for each from you. Each is a
   new `case` in `Evaluate`'s switch (`internal/handler/handler.go`) — not
   a refactor — once supplied.
5. **Consuming `entity.created`** — `tenant-entity-registry-svc` now
   really publishes this event (confirmed after the `origin/main` merge),
   so it is technically wireable, but nothing specifies what policy-svc
   should *do* with it (e.g. validate `legal_entity_id` references?
   invalidate a future cache entry? nothing?). Needs a specified behavior
   from you before it's buildable — building a consumer with no defined
   action would be dead infrastructure.

### Deferred by your explicit choice, confirmed 2026-07-08 (not blocked — revisit only if you change your mind)

6. **Caching layer** in front of policy reads — `05-security.md` §6.5
   allows it, doesn't require it; direct Postgres reads are fine at
   current scale.
7. **`tenant_id`/`legal_entity_id` on the `policies` table itself** —
   confirmed to stay off; all scoping lives on `PolicyVersion` rows,
   mirroring `jurisdiction-rules-svc`'s design.
8. **A standalone "validate threshold applicability" endpoint** — folded
   into `Evaluate` instead; no separate endpoint exists.

### Not blocked at all — just not done yet (pure backlog, pick up any time)

9. **Real `kafka.Writer` in `internal/events/publisher.go`** — still a
   logged stub (`// TODO: publish to Kafka topic`). Unlike when this was
   first written, the Kafka backbone is now real for
   `identity-context-svc` and `tenant-entity-registry-svc` — so this is
   no longer blocked by "no Kafka backbone exists anywhere," it's simply
   not been prioritized. Wiring it would follow the same pattern those two
   services already use.

**Synced with `origin/main` (2026-07-07):** pulled 13 commits from `main`
into `shashi-changes` before committing this work. Notable changes that
landed independently of policy-svc: `identity-context-svc` and
`tenant-entity-registry-svc` got real Kafka producers (no longer
log-only stubs — worth re-checking against `context.md`/`progress.md`'s
"nothing publishes events for real yet" framing before relying on it for
future services), `jurisdiction-rules-svc` got its admin endpoints wired
(previously commented out — the exact endpoints this service's Batch A
was modeled on), and `audit-event-store-svc` got a real server,
Dockerfile, and docker-compose entry. Merge was clean — no conflicts in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` or `services/README.md` despite both being
touched on both sides. Re-ran the full test suite post-merge: still
clean, nothing in policy-svc affected.

## Batch D — Close the evidence-obligation gap (post-review, 2026-07-07)

A spec-compliance review against the literal text of `03-microservices.md`
§8.1 found one real, unclosed gap: `Evaluate` returned `rule_basis`/
`policy_version_id` in its HTTP response but **never persisted anything**
— the "preserve evaluation basis for governed decisions" evidence
obligation was not actually met, only structurally set up for later. This
batch closes it. **Done, built, tested, and verified against a real,
independently-running `governance-decision-log-svc` instance — see
`context.md` §19.**

- [x] New `internal/decisionlog` package — `Client` interface +
      `HTTPClient`, POSTs to `governance-decision-log-svc`'s
      `POST /v1/decisions` after every real `APPROVAL_THRESHOLD`
      evaluation (not on `404`/`501` paths — nothing was evaluated there)
- [x] Two contract mismatches discovered and resolved while wiring this,
      not assumed away:
  - governance-decision-log-svc requires `tenant_id`/`legal_entity_id`
    non-empty on every decision; policy-svc legitimately allows both nil
    (global policies). Resolved with a `"GLOBAL"` sentinel value,
    confirmed accepted by a real instance with no special-casing needed
    on the decision-log side.
  - governance-decision-log-svc requires `actor_id`; `Evaluate`'s
    original request shape had no actor field at all. Added
    **`evaluated_by_principal_id`** as a new required field on
    `POST /v1/policies/evaluate` — a breaking change to an
    already-shipped, already-Postman-tested endpoint. Updated all
    existing tests and this doc's earlier endpoint reference accordingly.
- [x] `decision_id` field added to the evaluate request — **shipped
      optional in this batch, made required a follow-up pass later the
      same day (see Batch E below) once the duplicate-evidence-on-retry
      gap this created was judged worth closing immediately rather than
      documenting and moving on.**
- [x] Call is synchronous (matches this codebase's actual convention for
      Kafka publishing, not a goroutine) but best-effort: failures are
      logged, never surfaced or blocking — verified live by killing
      `governance-decision-log-svc` mid-session and confirming `Evaluate`
      still returned `200`.
- [x] HTTP client timeout tightened from an initial 5s to **2s** after
      live testing showed a DNS-resolution failure alone (fully-down
      dependency) cost ~2.5s wall-clock — a real, measured latency risk
      against the docs' "must not become a bottleneck" requirement for
      Policy Service, not a hypothetical one.

**Verified against a real, second live service (2026-07-07 — DONE):**
stood up an actual `governance-decision-log-svc` instance (its own
Postgres database, same Docker network) — not a stub. Ran `Evaluate`
with a caller-supplied `decision_id` and real `tenant_id`/
`legal_entity_id`, then fetched that exact `decision_id` back from
`governance-decision-log-svc` directly and confirmed every field
(`actor_id`, `outcome`, `rule_basis`, `evaluation_context`,
`correlation_id`) matched. Repeated with no `tenant_id`/`legal_entity_id`
and confirmed both come back as `"GLOBAL"`. Then stopped
`governance-decision-log-svc` entirely and confirmed `Evaluate` still
returns `200` with the failure only logged.

### Postman impact (superseded by Batch E — see there for the current body shape)

`POST /v1/policies/evaluate` now requires `evaluated_by_principal_id` in
the body — existing saved requests need updating or they'll fail `400
missing_field`. Example (incomplete as of Batch E — `decision_id` is also
required now):

```json
{"policy_type":"APPROVAL_THRESHOLD","action_context":{"amount":7500},"evaluated_by_principal_id":"admin-1"}
```

## Batch E — Close the retry-duplicate-decision gap (same day, follow-up)

Prompted by a direct "so what we need to do to make it 100% aligned"
follow-up. §19/Batch D above left one loose end: `decision_id` was
optional, so a client-side retry of `Evaluate` with none supplied could
record a duplicate decision in `governance-decision-log-svc`. Re-checked
against doctrine's idempotency requirement applied to the evidence write
specifically (not just `Evaluate`'s returned result) and judged: this
needed no business input, only an implementation decision, so it was
fixed immediately instead of added to the standing gap list. **Done,
tested, and verified live — see `context.md` §20.**

- [x] `decision_id` changed from optional to **required** on
      `POST /v1/policies/evaluate` — second breaking change to this
      endpoint today (first was `evaluated_by_principal_id` in Batch D)
- [x] Removed the `uuid.New()` fallback generation in
      `evaluateApprovalThreshold` — `google/uuid` no longer imported in
      `internal/handler`
- [x] 35/35 tests pass (34 from Batch D + `TestEvaluate_MissingDecisionID`;
      `TestEvaluate_ApprovalRequired` updated to assert the *supplied*
      `decision_id` is forwarded verbatim rather than asserting one gets
      generated)

**Verified live (2026-07-07 — DONE):** `POST /v1/policies/evaluate` with
`decision_id` omitted → `400 {"error":"missing_field","field":"decision_id"}`.
Called `Evaluate` **twice** with the identical `decision_id` against the
real `governance-decision-log-svc` instance, then queried
`GET /v1/decisions?actor=admin-1` and counted matches — **exactly one**
decision record after two calls. This is the actual guarantee, proven,
not just documented.

### Postman impact (current — supersedes the Batch D example above)

`POST /v1/policies/evaluate` requires **both** `evaluated_by_principal_id`
**and** `decision_id`. Current full example:

```json
{"policy_type":"APPROVAL_THRESHOLD","action_context":{"amount":7500},"evaluated_by_principal_id":"admin-1","decision_id":"some-unique-id-you-control"}
```

Use a stable, caller-generated ID (e.g. your own request/correlation ID)
so retries of the same logical evaluation don't create duplicate evidence

## Batch F — Persist activated_by/activated_at (2026-07-08, NOT YET VERIFIED LIVE)

Found during a second spec-compliance pass, prompted by "can we be 100%
aligned" — re-checking `04-data-model.md` §7.1's literal `PolicyVersion`
field list (`activated_by`, `activated_at`) against the actual schema
found neither existed. Tracing it through the code: `activated_by_principal_id`
is required on `POST /v1/policies/{id}/versions/{id}/activate` (`400` if
missing — this was already true), but the value was then dropped —
`PgStore.ActivateVersion` accepted it as an `actorID` parameter and never
used it again. Not persisted to the database (no such columns existed),
not included in the `policy.version.activated` event payload, not sent
anywhere else. "Who activated this policy version" was collected and
discarded on every call. This needed no business input to fix — only an
implementation decision — so it was fixed directly, same posture as
Batches D/E.

- [x] New migration `000002_add_activation_audit.{up,down}.sql` — adds
      nullable `activated_by_principal_id TEXT` and
      `activated_at TIMESTAMPTZ` to `policy_versions`. Nullable because
      DRAFT versions have neither yet.
- [x] `domain.PolicyVersion` gained `ActivatedByPrincipalID *string` and
      `ActivatedAt *time.Time`.
- [x] `pg_store.go`: `policyVersionColumns`/`scanPolicyVersion` extended;
      `transitionVersionStatus` gained an `activatedByPrincipalID *string`
      parameter — nil for non-activation transitions (keeps the helper
      generic rather than hardcoding activation semantics into it), stamps
      both columns via `COALESCE`/conditional `NOW()` when non-nil.
      `ActivateVersion`'s call into it now passes `&actorID`.
- [x] Design choice: activation audit fields are stamped **once** and
      never overwritten — when a version is later superseded, its own
      `activated_by`/`activated_at` are left untouched (that raw UPDATE is
      a separate query from `transitionVersionStatus` and never touches
      these columns). Superseding a version must not erase the record of
      who originally activated it.
- [x] `internal/events/publisher.go`: `PublishVersionActivated`'s payload
      now includes `activated_by_principal_id`/`activated_at`.
- [x] Tests extended in `pg_store_test.go` (not yet run):
      `TestPgStore_ActivateVersion_SupersedesPreviousActiveAndIsIdempotent`
      now asserts activation stamps both fields, that an idempotent retry
      does not change `activated_at`, and that superseding a version
      (with a *different* actor activating the replacement) leaves the
      superseded version's own `activated_by`/`activated_at` untouched.
      `setupTestDB` now also applies migration `000002`.
- [ ] **Not run this session** — no Go toolchain, no running Docker
      daemon available. Unlike every batch before it, this code has not
      been compiled, vetted, or tested. **Required before trusting this
      batch**: `go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test ./... -v`
      (unit tests need no DB; the extended integration test needs
      `TEST_DATABASE_URL` pointed at a Postgres instance with migrations
      000001 and 000002 both applied — `setupTestDB` in
      `pg_store_test.go` now does this automatically for the test DB, but
      any manually-migrated environment, including a real deployment,
      needs 000002 applied explicitly).
records in `governance-decision-log-svc`.

Repo correction: remote is `ZoikoGroup/zoiko-suite-backend`. Services
that exist now: `identity-context-svc` (8080), `tenant-entity-registry-svc`
(8081), `jurisdiction-rules-svc` (8082), `governance-decision-log-svc`
(8083). `policy-svc` is assigned **port 8085** (not 8084 — reserved
defensively in case `configuration-feature-flag-svc` lands first).

Design approach: mirror `jurisdiction-rules-svc` directly rather than
inventing a new shape — `Policy` ↔ `Jurisdiction` (lightweight named
container), `PolicyVersion` ↔ `JurisdictionRule` (effective-dated,
state-machined versions). Same idempotent
`INSERT...ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` dedup, same "handler owns the state
machine, store just enforces caller-supplied `allowedPriors`" split.

## Batch A — Policy / PolicyVersion CRUD

Branch off `main`. Mirrors `jurisdiction-rules-svc`'s `domain/types.go`,
`internal/store/pg_store.go` (`CreateJurisdiction`, `CreateRule`,
`TransitionRuleStatus`), and its migration directly (`context.md`
§13.1–13.3). **Code written, not yet compiled/tested** — see the caveat
at the top of this file.

- [x] `policies` table: `policy_id`, `policy_code`, `policy_name`,
      `policy_type` (VARCHAR, data-driven — `APPROVAL_THRESHOLD`,
      `SPEND_CONTROL`, `SOD_RULE`, `SIGNATORY_MATRIX`; new types are a
      data row, never a code change), `created_at`,
      `created_by_principal_id` — `deployments/migrations/000001_initial_schema.up.sql`
- [x] `policy_versions` table: `policy_version_id`, `policy_id`,
      `tenant_id` (nullable — null = global), `legal_entity_id`
      (nullable), `rule_payload` (JSONB), `effective_from`,
      `effective_to`, `version_status` (`DRAFT`/`ACTIVE`/`SUPERSEDED`/
      `RETIRED`), `created_at`, `created_by_principal_id` — same migration
- [x] No `UPDATE`/`DELETE` on either table — enforced by only ever writing
      `INSERT` (create) or the single `version_status`-only `UPDATE` used
      by activation/supersede in `internal/store/pg_store.go`
- [x] Standard entrypoint wiring: config → zap → pgxpool fail-fast →
      store → handler → `/healthz` + `/readyz` → graceful shutdown —
      `cmd/server/main.go`, `internal/config/config.go`,
      `internal/health/health.go` (byte-for-byte structural copy of
      `jurisdiction-rules-svc`'s shape, service name/port swapped)
- [x] `POST /v1/policies` — `internal/handler/handler.go: CreatePolicy`
- [x] `POST /v1/policies/{policy_id}/versions` —
      `internal/handler/handler.go: CreatePolicyVersion`
- [x] `POST /v1/policies/{policy_id}/versions/{version_id}/activate` —
      `internal/handler/handler.go: ActivateVersion`, backed by
      `internal/store/pg_store.go: ActivateVersion` — supersedes the prior
      ACTIVE version and activates the target in one DB transaction
      (supersede-then-activate ordering so the partial unique index
      `idx_policy_versions_one_active_per_scope` is never violated
      mid-transaction), reusing the same generic
      `UPDATE ... WHERE version_status = ANY($allowedPriors)` primitive
      (`transitionVersionStatus`) that mirrors `TransitionRuleStatus`
- [x] `GET /v1/policies/{policy_id}/versions` —
      `internal/handler/handler.go: ListVersionHistory`
- [x] Unit tests (stub store, no DB) — `internal/handler/handler_test.go`:
      created/idempotent-replay/missing-field/conflict/store-unavailable
      for `CreatePolicy`; created/missing-field/policy-not-found for
      `CreatePolicyVersion`; success/missing-actor/policy-id-mismatch/
      invalid-transition for `ActivateVersion`; empty-array/not-found/
      newest-first for `ListVersionHistory`
- [x] Integration tests (`TEST_DATABASE_URL`-guarded, skip if unset) —
      `internal/store/pg_store_test.go`: `CreatePolicy` idempotency+409,
      `CreatePolicyVersion` idempotency+409+policy-not-found,
      `ActivateVersion` supersede+idempotent-retry+invalid-transition,
      `ListVersionHistory` newest-first-includes-superseded

**Verified against real Postgres (2026-07-07 — DONE):** created a policy,
created a version, activated it, created a second version and activated
that too — confirmed the first version is `SUPERSEDED` (not deleted) and
the history endpoint shows both, newest first. Also verified the
idempotent-retry path over real HTTP: POSTing the identical
`CreatePolicyVersion` request twice returns `201` then `200` (not a false
`409` — see the bug fix below). All 19 Go tests pass
(`go test ./... -v` inside a `golang:1.25-alpine` container against a
throwaway `postgres:16-alpine` container).

### Bug found and fixed during verification: JSONB whitespace comparison

`internal/store/pg_store.go`'s `CreatePolicyVersion` conflict check
originally used `bytes.Equal(v.RulePayload, params.RulePayload)` to
detect whether a dedup-key match had a genuinely differing payload (409)
vs. an identical idempotent retry (200). Postgres's JSONB type
re-serializes with its own whitespace convention (a space after every
`:` and `,`) — so a compact-JSON request body (e.g.
`{"threshold_amount":5000}`, the format Go's own `json.Marshal` produces)
read back from the DB as `{"threshold_amount": 5000}` would **never**
byte-match the original request, causing every legitimate idempotent
retry to incorrectly 409. Caught by
`TestPgStore_CreatePolicyVersion_IdempotencyConflictAndPolicyNotFound`
failing on first real run. Fixed by replacing the byte comparison with a
semantic one (`jsonEqual`: unmarshal both sides, `reflect.DeepEqual`) —
insensitive to whitespace, key order, and numeric formatting. Confirmed
fixed both by the retest (19/19 pass) and by a live curl repro.

### Required local verification (for you to re-confirm independently)

The above was run in the assistant's own Docker-based sandbox, not your
machine — re-run at least once locally / in CI before merging:

1. `cd services/policy-svc && go mod tidy` — regenerates `go.sum` locally
   (already regenerated once in the assistant's sandbox; diff it against
   what you get)
2. `go build ./...` and `go vet ./...`
3. `go test ./...` (unit tests, no DB needed)
4. Spin up Postgres, set `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, re-run `go test ./...` for
   `internal/store/pg_store_test.go`
5. `go run ./cmd/server` against real Postgres and re-walk the HTTP round
   trip by hand (or via Postman — see the endpoint reference already
   shared)

## Batch B — Evaluation (the core value of the service)

Branch off `main`, on top of Batch A once policy/version CRUD exists.
This is what `03-microservices.md` §8.1 means by "evaluate policy against
action context" and "validate threshold applicability." **Code written,
built, tested (27/27 pass), and verified live — see `context.md` §17.**

Scope narrowly — do **not** build a generic engine for all four policy
types in one pass. Implement real evaluation for exactly one type:
`APPROVAL_THRESHOLD`. A plain `switch` on `policy_type` is the right
amount of structure; no plugin/registry system for four total cases.

- [x] `GET /v1/policies?policy_type=X&tenant_id=Y&legal_entity_id=Z` —
      the "get applicable policy set" API — `ListApplicablePolicyVersions`
      in `internal/handler/handler.go`, backed by
      `internal/store/pg_store.go: FindApplicableVersions`. Returns every
      currently-ACTIVE version compatible with the given scope, ordered
      most-specific-scope first (exact tenant+entity match, then
      tenant-only, then global) — see `context.md` §15 item 5 for the
      precedence rule and its documented v1 limitation (tie-break when
      multiple distinct policies share a type at the same tier)
- [x] `POST /v1/policies/evaluate` — `Evaluate` in `handler.go`
  - [x] look up the applicable ACTIVE version for that type+scope (reuses
        `FindApplicableVersions`, takes the most specific match)
  - [x] **no applicable policy → `404`** — confirmed live: evaluating an
        unrelated `policy_type` with nothing active returns
        `{"error":"no_applicable_policy",...}`
  - [x] for `APPROVAL_THRESHOLD`: compare `action_context.amount` against
        `rule_payload.threshold_amount` — `amount > threshold` →
        `APPROVAL_REQUIRED`, `amount <= threshold` (including exactly
        equal) → `WITHIN_THRESHOLD` (a documented choice, not specified
        by the task — see `context.md` §15 item 6)
  - [x] response: `{"result": ..., "policy_version_id": "...",
        "rule_basis": "<policy_code>:<policy_version_id>"}` — the
        `rule_basis` format is a documented choice, not specified by the
        task (§15 item 6); feeding `governance-decision-log-svc`'s
        `POST /v1/decisions` **was** a separate future task when this was
        written — **done in Batch D below**, don't trust this line alone
  - [x] unimplemented `policy_type` (e.g. `SPEND_CONTROL`) → `501`, not a
        silent no-op or a crash
- [x] idempotency: **stale as originally written here — corrected by
      Batch D below.** At the time this batch shipped, "no write path
      exists anywhere in this batch" was true. As of Batch D, `Evaluate`
      does write (best-effort) to `governance-decision-log-svc` on every
      real evaluation; that write is idempotent only when the caller
      supplies `decision_id`. See Batch D's section for the full story.
- [x] **no caching** — not added; a direct Postgres read is used (this
      permanently supersedes the old speculative "Phase 9 — caching"
      plan; it's deferred indefinitely, not scheduled)

**Verified against real Postgres (2026-07-07 — DONE):** activated an
`APPROVAL_THRESHOLD` version with `threshold_amount:5000`,
`POST /v1/policies/evaluate` with amount `7500` → `APPROVAL_REQUIRED`,
amount `1000` → `WITHIN_THRESHOLD`, amount `5000` (exactly equal) →
`WITHIN_THRESHOLD`; returned `policy_version_id` matched the version
activated. Also verified tenant-scope precedence and isolation live: a
tenant with its own override sees both its override (first) and the
global fallback (second); a different tenant with no override sees only
the global fallback and never leaks the first tenant's data — see
`context.md` §17 for the full transcript.

## Batch C — Events, CI, Dockerfile, README

Branch off `main`, once policy CRUD and evaluation both exist and are
tested. **Done, built, tested, and verified via a real Docker image run
— see `context.md` §18.**

- [x] Event publishing — `internal/events/publisher.go`, mirrors
      `governance-decision-log-svc/internal/events/publisher.go` exactly
      (same `envelope` struct, same log-only stub `emit()`, no real Kafka
      writer yet — `// TODO: publish to Kafka topic` left in place):
  - [x] `policy.created` on policy creation (first insert only — verified
        not re-published on idempotent replay, `TestCreatePolicy_IdempotentReplay`)
  - [x] `policy.updated` on new version created (first insert only)
  - [x] `policy.version.activated` on activation (real transition only —
        verified not re-published on idempotent no-op retry,
        `TestActivateVersion_IdempotentNoOp_DoesNotRepublish`)
  - [x] `policy.rule.retired` on supersede — required extending
        `Store.ActivateVersion`'s return signature to
        `(*PolicyVersion, []*PolicyVersion, bool, error)` so the store can
        tell the handler *which* version(s) got superseded (via `RETURNING`
        on the supersede `UPDATE`) and *whether* a real transition happened
        at all (vs. idempotent no-op) — a genuine signature change across
        `Store` interface + `PgStore` + handler + all tests, not just new
        files. Confirmed live: activating a second version in the same
        scope correctly emits `policy.rule.retired` for the first, tied to
        the same correlation ID as the activating request.
- [x] CI — added `policy-svc` to `matrix.service` in
      `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and to the `TEST_DATABASE_URL`
      conditional. Confirmed the CI Postgres service container already
      creates a database named `testdb` shared across all matrix
      services (not `policy` — policy-svc's own `config.go` default of
      `policy` is only used outside CI; `TEST_DATABASE_URL` overrides it
      in tests regardless).
- [x] Dockerfile + `.dockerignore` — mirror
      `governance-decision-log-svc/Dockerfile` exactly (`golang:1.25-alpine`
      builder → `distroless/static-debian12:nonroot` runtime, static
      binary, `-trimpath -ldflags="-s -w"`); binary name `policy-svc`,
      `EXPOSE 8085`. **Actually built** (`docker build`) and **actually
      run** as a container against real Postgres — not just written.
- [x] Updated `services/README.md` — added the `policy-svc` row (port
      8085, one-line status).

**Verify:** build the Docker image and run the container against a real
Postgres — full create-policy → create-version → activate → evaluate
round trip from inside the container.

---

## Explicit non-goals (do not do these as part of this build)

- **Do not consume `entity.created`, `role.updated`, or
  `authority.delegated`** even though `03-microservices.md` §8.1 lists
  them as consumed events.
  - **`entity.created` — status changed since this was first written.**
    `tenant-entity-registry-svc` now has a real Kafka producer for it
    (confirmed after pulling `origin/main` — see "Synced with
    `origin/main`" note above). Consuming it is technically unblocked,
    but nothing in the docs specifies what policy-svc should *do* with
    an `entity.created` event — building a consumer with no defined
    business behavior would be infrastructure with no purpose. **Needs
    an answer from you** (e.g. "validate `legal_entity_id` references,"
    "invalidate a future cache entry," or "nothing, skip it") before
    this is buildable, not more unilateral engineering.
  - **`role.updated` / `authority.delegated` — still fully blocked.**
    Access Control Service and Delegated Authority Service don't exist
    at all yet. No amount of decision-making unblocks this; it needs
    those services to exist first.
- **Do not wire calls to Authorization Service** for admin writes
  (create/activate) — it doesn't exist yet. Same posture
  `governance-decision-log-svc` shipped with; revisit when Authorization
  Service exists.
- **Do not add caching/Redis/sidecar evaluation** in v1 — explicitly
  deferred (Batch B). Technically buildable now (no external blocker),
  but the spec explicitly allows deferring it ("may be cached... not
  required"), unlike the evidence obligation, which the spec does not
  allow deferring and which Batches D/E closed. Needs a "yes, build it"
  from you, not an assumption that it's wanted.
- **Do not build evaluation logic for `SPEND_CONTROL`, `SOD_RULE`, or
  `SIGNATORY_MATRIX`** — only `APPROVAL_THRESHOLD` gets real logic in v1;
  the others are future `switch` cases, not part of this build. **Cannot
  be built without you supplying the actual business rules** — the docs
  name these three policy types but give zero formulas or logic for any
  of them, unlike `APPROVAL_THRESHOLD`'s explicit "compare against a
  threshold" instruction.

## Blocking cross-service dependencies (tracked, not yet resolvable)

- **Authorization Service** — doesn't exist; deferred per non-goals
  above rather than blocking.
- **Access Control Service** / **Delegated Authority Service** — don't
  exist; block real consumption of `role.updated` / `authority.delegated`
  (deferred per non-goals above) — genuinely blocking, not a decision
  policy-svc can make on its own.
- **Kafka event backbone — status changed since this was first written.**
  It's real now for `identity-context-svc` and `tenant-entity-registry-svc`
  (real `kafka.Writer` producers, confirmed after the `origin/main` pull).
  Policy Service's own publisher (`internal/events/publisher.go`) is
  still a log-only stub — that part hasn't changed and isn't blocked by
  anything except priority; wiring a real `kafka.Writer` there would
  follow the same pattern those two services now use.

## Remaining gaps against a strict reading of `03-microservices.md` §8.1

As of Batch E, this was the complete list. **Status as of 2026-07-08:
every item that was awaiting a decision has now been explicitly decided
— see "Sign-off" below. None were silently closed; each was a deliberate
choice, not an oversight or a default.**

1. Consuming `entity.created` — needs you to specify intended behavior (see above)
2. Consuming `role.updated`/`authority.delegated` — blocked on services that don't exist
3. Caching — needs a "yes, build it" from you (not required by spec)
4. Evaluation logic for `SPEND_CONTROL`/`SOD_RULE`/`SIGNATORY_MATRIX` — needs business rules from you
5. `policies` table has no `tenant_id`/`legal_entity_id` — needs a decision on whether to reverse the Batch A design precedent (mirrors `jurisdictions`)
6. No literal separate "validate threshold applicability" endpoint (folded into `Evaluate`) — low value to fix, recommend leaving as-is unless you disagree

## Sign-off on remaining gaps (2026-07-08)

Asked directly, one decision per open item, rather than assuming any of
them. All four decidable items were confirmed **as originally
recommended** — no code changes resulted from this pass, only an
explicit record that "not built" is a deliberate, approved state, not a
gap:

1. **`entity.created` consumption — confirmed skip.** No business
   behavior has been specified for it; building a consumer with nothing
   to do would be dead infrastructure. Revisit only if/when a concrete
   use (e.g. validating `legal_entity_id` references) is specified.
2. **`role.updated`/`authority.delegated` — still blocked, not a
   decision.** Access Control Service and Delegated Authority Service
   don't exist. Nothing to sign off on until they do.
3. **Caching — confirmed skip.** Direct Postgres reads remain sufficient
   at current scale; 05-security.md §6.5 permits caching but does not
   require it for v1. Deferred indefinitely, not scheduled.
4. **`SPEND_CONTROL`/`SOD_RULE`/`SIGNATORY_MATRIX` evaluation — confirmed
   stay at `501 Not Implemented`.** No formulas exist anywhere in the
   architecture docs for these three types; implementing them now would
   mean inventing business logic rather than encoding a specified rule.
   Each remains a single new `switch` case in `Evaluate`
   (`handler.go`) whenever real rules are supplied — no refactor needed.
5. **`policies` table `tenant_id`/`legal_entity_id` — confirmed leave
   as-is.** `Policy` stays a global named container; all tenant/entity
   scoping stays on `PolicyVersion` rows, per the original Batch A
   design mirroring `jurisdiction-rules-svc`.
6. **Separate "validate threshold applicability" endpoint — not raised
   as an objection, so left folded into `Evaluate`** per the standing
   recommendation.

**Net effect: policy-svc's v1 scope is now fully aligned to
`03-microservices.md` §8.1, `04-data-model.md` §7.1/7.2, and
`05-security.md` §6.5/§9.2/§14 — every clause is either implemented and
verified (Batches A–E) or explicitly, consciously deferred with a
recorded reason and a re-open trigger (a service landing, or business
rules being supplied). Nothing remains in an undecided state.** The two
genuinely blocking items (row 2, and Authorization Service wiring for
admin writes) cannot be resolved by any decision available today — they
require other services to exist first.
